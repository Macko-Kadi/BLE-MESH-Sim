/**
 * 
 * I suggest to consider some obstacles, or something that will modify path loss (see Medium class). Our nodes work inside a building:
 * Packet delivery from 1 - 4 should be like 1-2-3-4 because the reception power of direct 1-4 transmission should be very reduced

 *        xxx
 *   1 o  xxx  o 4
 *        xxx
 *  2 o       o 3

 * o - node, x - obstacle
